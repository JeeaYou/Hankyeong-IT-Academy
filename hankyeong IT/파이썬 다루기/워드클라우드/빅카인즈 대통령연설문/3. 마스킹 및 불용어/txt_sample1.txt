Starry starry night
Paint your palette blue and grey
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul.

Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land.
 
And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free.

They would not listen 
they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now.
 
Starry starry night
Flaming flo'rs that brightly blaze
Sirling clouds in violet haze
Rreflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue.
 
Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand.
 
And now I understand
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free.
They would not listen they're not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now.
 
For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left in sight on that starry starry night.
You took your life as lovers often do;
 
But I could have told you
Vincent this world was never
Meant for one as beautiful as you.
 
Starry starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget.
 
Like the stranger that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn of bloddy rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow.
 
And now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free.
They would not listen they're not
List'ning still perhaps they never will.
